# SQL-Queries Portfolio
## Project and Objective
This portfolio file is from a project that I worked on where I looked at data from a fictional movie rental company called Rockbuster. In this project I used SQL to analyze the data and answer business questions with data driven answers.
## Data
The dataset comprises of the following information
* film inventory
* customers
* payments

The source of this data was Career Foundry
## Tableau Visualizations
